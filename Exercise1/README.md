In this exercise, the goal is to understand how the **Max Heap** data structure works and how its operations are implemented.

A Max Heap is a complete binary tree where each node is greater than or equal to its children.  
This property ensures that the **maximum element is always at the root**.

The provided files were:
- `MaxHeapInterface.java` — defines the methods required for a Max Heap.
- `MaxHeap.java` — implements the Max Heap logic.
- `Test.java` — contains test cases to demonstrate heap operations.

I reviewed the given code files (`MaxHeapInterface.java`, `MaxHeap.java`, and `Test.java`)  
and ran the program to observe how elements are inserted and removed while maintaining the heap property.

Below is the output of the program when running `Test.java`:


The heap is not empty; it contains 6 entries.
The largest entry is 21


Removing entries in descending order:
Removing 21
Removing 20
Removing 15
Removing 14
Removing 10
Removing 2
